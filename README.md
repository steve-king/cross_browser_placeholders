Cross Browser Placeholders
==========================

Simple jQuery polyfill to provide placeholder support to form inputs and textareas in older browsers.

The last 4 lines add a ‘focus’ class to text inputs and textareas, so you can style a focus state in older browsers too.

Requires jQuery and Modernizr.
